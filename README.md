# react-native-qrcode-scanner

This library was originally written as a plug and play QRCode scanner for React Native without a ton of setup. Since then, the ecosystem has evolved quite a bit, resulting in newer libraries requiring less setup and reducing the need for this project to exist. As such this library has been archived.

## Why we need it?
One of our customers has this library in their ecosystem. I tried to use the latest tools, but errors occur and the application crashes. A faster and safer solution is to keep and run this library.
